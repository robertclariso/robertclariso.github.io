## Blogging

- I am a regular collaborator in [Informática++](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/), the technology blog at the IT, Multimedia and Telecommunications Department at UOC, which targets a general audience. [Here](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/author/robert/) you can find a list of my posts.
- I have also collaborated in [Crónicas del intangible](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2018/01/16/actualidad/1516121401_534975.html), the computer science blog from [SISTEDES](https://sistedes.es) published in the digital version of the [El País](https://elpais.com/) newspaper.
