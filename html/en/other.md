## Blogging

- I am a regular collaborator in [Informática++](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/), the technology blog at the IT, Multimedia and Telecommunications Department at UOC. It is aimed as less technical audience. [Here](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/author/robert/) you can find a list of my posts, and the following are a few of the ones I'm most proud of:
  - ["Don't let your project sink"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2011/07/11/que-no-se-hunda-tu-proyecto/): Discusses the similarities between many software projects and the shripwreck of the [Vasa warship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)). 
  - ["Trade-offs in computer science"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2019/02/04/trade-offs-ingenieria-informatica/).
  - ["Why is software quality so hard to achieve?"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/04/18/por-que-es-tan-dificil-conseguir-software-de-calidad/). 
  - ["The processor that could not divide"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/01/12/el-procesador-que-no-sabia-dividir/): About the infamous Pentium FDIV bug. 
  - ["Code obfuscation: try to understand this program"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2015/10/26/ofuscacion-de-codigo-te-reto-a-que-entiendas-este-programa/).
  - ["Code optimization: a way more efficient code"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/05/02/optimizacion-de-codigo-un-codigo-mas-eficiente/): Explains the how low-level code is optimized by modern compilers.
  - ["Wirth's law: software's reverse Moore's law"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2014/05/22/la-ley-de-wirth-la-ley-de-moore-inversa-del-software/): Explores why software seems to be getting slower why hardware is always getting faster.
  - ["How do you say 'Ingeniería informática' in English?"](http://informatica.blogs.uoc.edu/2011/06/06/como-traducir-ingenieria-informatica-al-ingles/): A hotter topic that you would expect! For many years, this has been the most popular post of the entire blog.
- I have also participated in [Crónicas del intangible](https://elpais.com/agr/cronicas_del_intangible/a), the computer science blog from [SISTEDES](https://sistedes.es) published in the digital version of the [El País](https://elpais.com/) newspaper. 
  - ["Software ages like you do"](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2018/01/16/actualidad/1516121401_534975.html) with Jordi Cabot: Explains the need for software maintenance to the general public.
