I am a member of the [SOM Research Lab](https://som-research.uoc.edu), an [ICREA](https://www.icrea.cat)-[UOC](https://www.uoc.edu) research group within the [Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)](https://in3.uoc.edu) at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

My **research interests** include:
- Formal methods.
- Model-driven software engineering.
- Tools for e-learning.

If you are looking for a **PhD advisor**, you can find a list of open research lines [here](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/escola-doctorat/linies-recerca/linies-nit/software-engineering/index.html). I supervise PhD thesis within the [Network and Information Technologies PhD Programme](http://studies.uoc.edu/web/estudia/en/doctoral-programmes/technologies-information-networks/presentation) at the [UOC Doctoral School](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/escola-doctorat/index.html). There is a yearly call for new candidates which opens around January-March, with a limited number of grants for exceptional candidates.
