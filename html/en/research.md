## Research tools and software

I have co-authored the following research tools:

- [UMLtoCSP](http://gres.uoc.edu/UMLtoCSP/): A tool for the verification and validation of UML class diagrams annotated with OCL constraints.
UMLtoCSP is implemented in Java and uses the [ECLiPSe](http://eclipseclp.org/) contraint logic programming solver. 
- [EMFtoSCP](https://github.com/SOM-Research/EMFtoCSP): An evolution of UMLtoCSP for the analysis of class diagrams in EMF format.
- [FeatureX](https://github.com/5Quintessential/FeatureX): A tool for the extraction of feature models of a software product line from a set of textual requirements. 
FeatureX is implemented in Python and uses the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) for the analysis of natural language text.
