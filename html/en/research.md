## Research lines

My research interests include:
- Formal methods
- Model-driven software engineering
- Tools for e-learning

If you are looking for a **PhD advisor**, you can find a list of open research lines [here](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/escola-doctorat/linies-recerca/linies-nit/software-engineering/index.html). I supervise PhD thesis within the [Network and Information Technologies PhD Programme](http://studies.uoc.edu/web/estudia/en/doctoral-programmes/technologies-information-networks/presentation) at the [UOC Doctoral School](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/escola-doctorat/index.html). There is a yearly call for new candidates which opens around January-March, with a limited number of grants for exceptional candidates. If you are interested, please [get in touch](https://robertclariso.github.io).

## Research tools and software

I have co-authored the following research tools:

- [UMLtoCSP](http://gres.uoc.edu/UMLtoCSP/): A tool for the verification and validation of UML class diagrams annotated with OCL constraints.
UMLtoCSP is implemented in Java and uses the [ECLiPSe](http://eclipseclp.org/) contraint logic programming solver. 

- [EMFtoSCP](https://github.com/SOM-Research/EMFtoCSP): An evolution of UMLtoCSP for the analysis of class diagrams in EMF format.

- [FeatureX](https://github.com/5Quintessential/FeatureX): A tool for the extraction of feature models of a software product line from a set of textual requirements. 
FeatureX is implemented in Python and uses the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) for the analysis of natural language text.
