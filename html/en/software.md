# Research tools & software

I have co-authored the following research tools:

- **[UMLtoCSP](http://gres.uoc.edu/UMLtoCSP/):** A tool for the verification and validation of UML class diagrams annotated with OCL constraints.
The tools is implemented in Java and uses the [ECLiPSe](http://eclipseclp.org/) contraint logic programming solver. 

- **[EMFtoSCP](https://github.com/SOM-Research/EMFtoCSP):** An adaptation of UMLtoCSP for the analysis of class diagrams in EMF format.

- **[FeatureX](https://github.com/5Quintessential/FeatureX):** A tool for the extraction of feature models of a software product line from a set of textual requirements. 
The tools is implemented in Python and uses the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) for the analysis of natural language text.
